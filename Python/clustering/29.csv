Consequence of Error/Judgement
The Scheduling Analyst is a representative of Scheduling Services and liaises with ES staff and various members of the university community including UBC IT, faculties and service units. This is a highly visible position, which has continuous contact with Enrolment Services staff and a very diverse university and public community. Projects coordinated by the incumbent will directly impact faculty, staff and student relationships with UBC and the outside community. Failure to adequately involve stakeholders could result in ineffective design of technologies to support business operations or the ineffective use of available technologies resulting in unnecessary work by faculty, staff and administrators. Inability to liaise appropriately with UBC IT could lead to unsustainable technology deployment or unnecessary downtime of systems which could negatively impact system availability for faculty and staff and service to students.
The success of these projects directly impacts the recruitment and retention of students at both UBCV and UBCO and service delivery levels by faculty, staff and administrators. A thorough understanding pertaining to privacy legislation, policies and data security is required to adequately ensure the appropriate levels of security are met. Unless adequate management and monitoring take place, the integrity of the security of the SIS and student records would be jeopardized resulting in non-compliance and negative legal and reputational consequences for the University.
This position also carries responsibility for facilitating the testing of new and changed pieces of the Scheduling system. A thorough understanding of the Scheduling System (Scientia) complex structure is required to adequately identify possible problems.
