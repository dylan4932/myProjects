Data Scientist,PerfectRec,"Remote in Seattle, WA",NaN,PostedPosted 30+ days ago,"$130,000 - $300,000 a year","Exploratory data analysis and data visualization.
Solve technical problems across the stack and contribute to all parts of our code base, including creation of…",https://www.indeed.com/rc/clk?jk=22409aeaca7a375b&fccid=dd616958bd9ddc12&vjs=3,"About PerfectRec
PerfectRec is a machine-learning powered decision engine focused on helping people find good, personalized recommendations without exhaustive research. We are starting with electronics, then other products such as cars and clothing, but ultimately we'll expand into other, more complicated decisions such as where to live or work. (Since you're reading this, our non-ML based recommendation is that you really consider working here.)

We are starting with smartphones, laptops and other consumer electronics since there is an immediate and growing need for reliable recommendations for these products. Spammy search results, fake reviews, and paid affiliate sites make it nearly impossible to get an honest and relevant product recommendation. Finding the right item to meet your unique needs is tricky. And making the wrong choice based on bad information is a frustrating waste of time and money. We hope to attract billions of users, collectively save them billions and billions of hours on their product searches, and provide a similar amount of value by guiding our users to the right products for themselves.
We're solving the problem by combining actual human subject-area experts with machine learning to help everyone — regardless of their expertise — find their perfect product, quickly. To do that, we guide users through a series of questions about what they're looking for. After each answer, we share updated recommendations and encourage answering more questions to further improve our recommendations. Ultimately, we will get more information about a user's specific needs from a few quick multiple-choice questions than Amazon or Google can deduce from a search query and their past browsing data. This will enable us to make better recommendations tailored to each user's unique needs.
A Small Team Where You Can Have A Big Impact
PerfectRec is a small, early-stage startup where you can have a big impact. Our founding team has experience building successful startups and working at big organizations, like Google, Amazon, Twitch and UC Berkeley. We are growing fast, and looking for people who are excited to build a new product where they can have a big impact.
Founder Led, Founder Funded
Our CEO Joe Golden bootstrapped his first startup, Collage.com, to ~$100m in revenue and a successful exit in March 2021. He's using some of the proceeds from that sale to launch PerfectRec and give us a long runway of at least 3 years to build a great team and outstanding decision-engine.
Working At PerfectRec
We are an all-remote company, so we don't care where you live as long as you work well in a fast-paced, collaborative remote environment.
PerfectRec is an Equal Opportunity Employer. We are committed to finding the best candidates for every role and giving them the tools and guidance they need to succeed. Our all-remote structure enables us to recruit anywhere in the world, so our talent pool isn't limited to a few big cities, and our asynchronous structure allows our team to work when it's best for them. We celebrate diversity and are committed to creating an inclusive environment for all employees.
Learn more about how we work and our differentiating values.
What You'll Bring
Strong sense of ownership. Ownership is taking responsibility for the outcomes of a task or project. You'll relish these ownership opportunities and ensure that tasks, projects, or the team are making positive forward progress.
Clear and concise communication. Building software is a team sport that relies heavily on great communication. You'll be responsible for clear, thoughtful, and concise written and verbal communication. This includes the ability to give and receive feedback with empathy and understanding whether in a code review or a 1:1.
Willingness to teach and learn. We're always evolving with new tools and practices. You'll be willing to jump in and learn unfamiliar technologies while also bringing others along with you. Mentorship and helping others learn are important parts of achieving this.
Creative problem solving. Creating a decision engine that can make recommendations across wide ranging domains is hard, and the potential data sources are limitless. You'll be able to evaluate and explore existing sets of data, suggest new sources of data, and be able to build models that learn from this data in novel ways.
Balance of perfection and pragmatism. Software has a lot of trade-offs and ways to solve problems. You'll be able to recognize and balance the trade-offs between long-term system health and bringing value to customers faster. Your tooling choices will reflect ability to solve the problem the best way and not just the latest and greatest.
What You'll Do
Create and explore datasets for powering recommendations, working closely with domain experts.
Prototype models for making recommendations in new domains.
Identify ways to evaluate and compare competing models.
Add new capabilities that are shared between models in different categories.
Solve technical problems across the stack and contribute to all parts of our code base, including creation of our internal machine learning library.
Share your expertise and experience to grow with the team.
Collaborate with product, design, and engineers to understand customer needs, design solutions, and prototype, launch, and iterate.
Build a product that is genuinely loved by users and respects their time.
Relevant Experience
We believe that everybody has the ability to learn and grow. So, relevant doesn't mean required or that you need everything on the list (this isn't a Pokédex). If you've used other tools, languages, and frameworks that are similar to what is listed, please apply! We only list specific tools so that you know the tech stack you're walking into.
Python or R.
Exploratory data analysis and data visualization.
Classical machine learning techniques like classification, regression, regularization, and cross-validation.
sklearn, Keras (or other deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow and PyTorch).
Recommender systems, including learning-to-rank.
SQL.
Technical writing.
Salary & Benefits
We believe in offering generous compensation and benefits tailored to our all-remote workplace. We pay well because we want to work with highly motivated people that will help make the company successful.
Pay Range and Level of Role
$130,000 - $300,000 salary and stock options which vest over 4 years. We are hiring data scientists with different levels of experience. Compensation is based on background and experience.
Benefits
100% remote and no cost-of-living pay cuts. We want you to work where you work best and we are not going to ""adjust"" your pay if you move somewhere with a lower cost of living.
We pay 100% of your and your dependents' healthcare premium in a high-quality, national PPO plan for US-based employees. For international employees, we will work with you if you're not covered by your national health plan.
We will buy the office equipment you need to succeed. Lots of companies are miserly about equipment. We are not going to do that because your time is valuable.
401k with generous matching. Once we have 20 employees, we'll set up a 401k program with generous matching.
Generous PTO. We trust everyone to take time off appropriately for themselves. We're pro-regular vacations - not taking regular breaks isn't good for individuals or the team. Once we have 20 employees, we will establish a more formal PTO policy.
Worry-free sick days. If you're sick, take the time off to get well. Just let your manager know as soon as practicable.
Free products that we're reviewing. We are becoming product experts together, and we will send you cool stuff like monitors and TVs as we add new recommendation lines. (Unfortunately, we probably won't be able to do this for cars.)"

ABOUT US: *
The demand for home renovations has never been stronger, yet, it's surprisingly difficult for a new homeowner to renovate. It can take a decade to build up enough home equity and savings to pay for a major renovation. As a result, recent homeowners do a lot of financially-suboptimal things to compensate like borrow from their 401k, rack up credit card debt, and use high-interest personal loans. Or they just live unhappily for years in a home that doesn't meet their family's needs.
But by completing a major renovation, homeowners are increasing the value of their home. Professional real estate investors leverage this After Renovation Value (ARV) to roll the increase in value into new properties all the time. But there hasn't been a great way for homeowners to take advantage of this. If homeowners had an ability to borrow against the ARV, they could increase their borrowing power up to 10x.
To meet this need, RenoFi created a platform that enables homeowners to borrow funds from RenoFi approved lenders in the form of the first home equity loan purpose-built for renovations! Unlike standard home equity loans, RenoFi Loans use the value of your home post-renovation which lets you borrow the most money at the best possible terms. RenoFi is creating a full suite of renovation loan products to better suit the needs of today’s homeowners!
For homeowners, RenoFi makes it possible to renovate years earlier than might be otherwise feasible. For contractors, we empower the financing of renovations at the point of sale, reducing instances of scope reduction, and ensuring prompt payment. Our lender partners, most often credit unions, rely on RenoFi's platform to generate loans, create efficiencies, and grow membership. The lenders pay RenoFi for the new loans, which allows us to offer our services to homeowners for free. RenoFi is truly a win-win-win for everyone involved.
RenoFi is backed by some of the best startup investors in the world, including First Round Capital, Comcast Ventures, and Canaan Partners.
*
WE ARE A GLOBALLY DISTRIBUTED TEAM*
RenoFi has been built from the start as a fully distributed team with an intentional focus on growing a strong team and culture that spans timezones and nationalities. Here's one fun example!
Please highlight any prior experience working remotely when applying. US or GMT-adjacent timezones will be prioritized.
RenoFi offers competitive cash and equity compensation. Some benefit offerings will vary from country to country. In the United States, we offer competitive health and retirement plans. All staff across the globe enjoy a flexible vacation policy.

However, the last key component, data, largely remains trapped behind barriers of regulation, privacy, schema standards and competitive risk. Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

We
- come from various fields - engineering, mathematics, physics and arts.
- are allergic to over-engineering.
- are anarchists at heart and like to hack around the status quo.
love playing board and video games.
- are radically honest and appreciate challenging one another, rather than giving out “pats on the back”. Yet, we can always rely on each other for support, feedback and results.
- are willing to learn and adapt quickly to new situations and requirements. Languages, frameworks, libraries, compilers, etc. are just tools for a job. A new problem might need a new tool. If it doesn’t exist yet, we will build it.

As an early member of our data science team, you will help
- push the limits of what can be done with data.
- build the team and drive the direction of the company.
- shape our product and culture.
- experience the direct impact of what you build on hundreds of millions of people’s financial lives.

Pearl Health is restoring the independence and joy of practicing medicine for doctors in America. Our healthcare system has burdened our doctors with too much process, while removing them from what they do best: caring for those we love most. We launched Pearl Health because we believe primary care providers, armed with the proper tools and resources, can have an outsized impact in achieving high-quality, affordable healthcare. We foresee a shift to an increasingly value-based future where physicians and provider groups will participate in the value they create for the healthcare system and will increasingly require proper tooling, information systems, capital support, and technology to succeed in these models.
We are a team of physicians (Groups), practice-enablement experts (VillageMD, Steward, Stellar), technologists (athenahealth, TrialSpark, Flatiron Health) and health plan leaders (Oscar, Clover, Centivo) who believe that primary care providers (PCPs) are the key to America's future health. Today, we support over 100 providers in value-based Medicare models and are on track to substantially increase the Medicare population we will be responsible for managing with our physician partners for 2023 (+$300M of Medicare benchmark risk). Our investors include Andreessen Horowitz and AlleyCorp.
What we hope you can do...
We are seeking a brilliant Data Scientist with a track record of propelling business strategies through analytical insights and algorithmic systems. Your work will be a core asset of our company, allowing us to more efficiently provide better care to our members and to create novel financial arrangements for each of our aligned physicians. You should be a strategic and analytical thinker, an effective communicator, an expert in analytical and data infrastructure systems, comfortable working with actuaries on complicated risk analyses, and performing sophisticated modeling exercises independently. We anticipate that AI, ML, and NLP will be central elements of our product, so you should have a deep familiarity with and passion for these technologies.
What a Data Scientist means to us...
Translate the company's goals and vision into its strategy and operations by conducting sophisticated quantitative analyses while informing decisions about our infrastructure and approach
Help us change the future of work for doctors in America by applying state of the art technology solutions, including machine learning, natural language processing, and explicable AI - likely in partnership with key external partners.
Experience developing and deploying sophisticated algorithmic approaches to prioritizing patient care in a clinical setting (or comparably sophisticated spaces).
Support all business lines, including sales and business development, by enabling those teams to nimbly make data-driven decisions, balancing competing goals, and making difficult trade-offs when required.
Partner effectively with our Chief Product Officer and Chief Technology Officer toward best-in-class analytics systems to give our physician partners insight into their patient panels.
Support the technology needs of various departments by creating a data-literate ecosystem.
Who you are…
4-7 years of experience in performing results-driven quantitative analysis in a collaborative environment.
Degree in statistics, applied math, computer science, engineering or a related field.
SQL expertise and strong foundation in at least one of the main data science programming languages. Python is our current primary language and is preferred.
A proven ability to conduct research and empower data-driven aspects of our product through a mix of internal resources and external vendors, especially in AI, ML and NLP domains.
Experience collaborating with data engineering teams to define needs for an ETL pipeline and familiarity with the most common ETL tools.
Thoughtful collaborator, able to manage multiple demanding stakeholders, assimilate complex information quickly, and scope work in a way that balances deep insight and fast turnaround.
Prior experience working with healthcare data in any part of the industry (payor, provider, pharmacy, etc.); familiarity with population health data is preferred but not essential
The First 90 Days….
We aren't the over-prescriptive types but to give you a sense of what we think we'll do in your first 3 months together:
First 30 Days: Get your hands dirty really understanding the universe of doctors we will be partnering with in our first year in the Direct Contracting model. Help us profile risk, identify opportunities for performance improvement, and lay the foundation for the work we will do in the year ahead. Take a crash course in the still new DCE model to ensure Pearl's continued leadership in understanding and explaining its value.
First 60 Days: Navigate the crucial launch window for the 2022 Performance Year where we will receive our first batch of data from our DCE partners and begin providing our service to our doctors. Become a subject matter expert on our datasets and define the measures we will use to guide our work throughout the performance year.
First 90 Days: Own the ongoing performance analysis and improvement process as we do both bespoke work with our practices and productize insights into the platform. Dig deep on the opportunities for growth within our existing universe of doctors and potential acquisitions for Performance Year 2.
Our Values
We are an Equal Opportunity Employer and our employees are people with different strengths, experiences and backgrounds, who share a passion for improving people's lives. Our definition of diversity not only includes race and gender identity, but also age, disability status, veteran status, sexual orientation, religion and many other parts of one's identity. We believe all of our colleague's points of view are integral to our success, and that inclusion is everyone's responsibility and a cause of beautiful things.
We welcome candidates from all backgrounds and are committed to a fair hiring process free from discrimination and focused around problem solving, improvement, and mutual empowerment.
Remote Work
We are a remote-first company, largely congregated on the East Coast, with concentrations of team members at our NYC headquarters and in the Boston area. While the world is in lockdown, we're all working remotely, but hope to facilitate more in-person time as the Covid situation improves. We expect a large part of our workforce to be remote after the pandemic ends.
Compensation and Benefits
The expected base pay range for this position is between $110,000 and $185,000 per year. Base pay is one component of Pearl's total compensation package, which also includes access to healthcare benefits, a 401(k) plan and company match, possible equity options, and much more.

Enabling scalable access to data will unlock enormous value for both individual developers and companies. This has only been made possible in the last few years, through advances in manifold learning algorithms and privacy-preserving computing. See our blog for more details.

One of the most valuable kinds of data today is in the financial sector. Financial data plays a key role across many industry verticals. However, it has notoriously been locked behind regulatory barriers and a lack of format standards. Our end product is an API that makes financial transactions accessible to both humans and machine-learning models, in a scalable and privacy-preserving way.

It’s like an always-on dinner party. We believe that good friendships are the foundation of everything, and we built Clubhouse to make it easier to fill your life with them.

We launched in 2020 and have grown quickly in the time since. Each day, millions of people are now exploring the hallways of Clubhouse, creating rooms about every topic imaginable.

We take pride in being a small and productive team, with a relentless focus on our product and the community. As a company we are well funded, with backing from a16z and dozens of the best angel investors in the world, providing us with years of runway. We love what we do and have a lot of work ahead of us. So if you’re a talented builder, come join the club!

The Role

As a Product Data Scientist, you will work closely with our product and engineering teams to formulate and answer key questions about our product. You will play a central role in collecting, modeling, and analyzing data, and will drive meaningful changes to our product and user experiences based on your findings.

In this role, you will report to our Head of Data Science. We are a remote friendly-company — with our headquarters in San Francisco and a strong commitment to ensuring people can do great work here and thrive without having to live near an office. This role is open to candidates across the U.S.

Who you are

You are curious, inquisitive, and enjoy solving ambiguous, open-ended problems. You are able to identify high impact problem areas with little direction. You have a healthy skepticism about data and know when to dig deeper into a problem.

You have the technical skills to work independently. You are comfortable with advanced modeling and statistical techniques and are highly fluent in SQL and Python. You have deep experience with experiment design and analysis. You have experience as a data scientist at a fast growing company and have a proven record of impact.

You are a strong communicator and are able to explain complex concepts to a wide audience. You are adept at crafting clear and impactful data visualizations.

You are meticulous and forthright. You are experienced with finding clear answers despite messy data sets, and are able to catch data issues as they arise.

You bias towards action. You like to build and ship - favoring practical choices, speed and a respect for sequencing. You focus on the things that matter and push back on things that don’t. You make deadlines for yourself and you move fast.

You’re scrappy and entrepreneurial. You thrive in fast-paced environments and are comfortable with not knowing the answer to something. You are willing to roll up your sleeves no matter what the challenge is.

You take pride in what you do. You care deeply about your work. You read through details and think about every bit of the user experience. If something seems off, you come up with a good solution and fix it without being asked to do so. You’re proactive with suggestions and people know they can count on you to get things done.

You enjoy your work. You love what you do, not because you feel you have to, but because you’re so excited to create something big for the world. Your favorite thing to do is to take on a huge challenge and pull it off.

You care about doing the right thing. You value diversity and go out of your way to ensure others feel welcome. You enjoy hanging out with your teammates, have a low-ego, and make the workplace more fun for everyone.

What you will do

In this role, you will play a key part in defining the data culture within Clubhouse and ensure that we have principled, data-driven decision-making processes. As part of the early data team, you will work on numerous zero-to-one projects and will have a direct impact on our product direction. You’ll have the opportunity to work alongside our product and engineering teams on high-profile feature launches that affect millions of people.

There are numerous complex product questions that we would look to a data partner to help the team untangle. On a given day, you may be performing and sharing complex analyses that inform a wide variety of decisions. Or you may be playing a hands-on role in new feature launches, ensuring that we understand the impact of policy changes on users and can identify potential issues early in the process. You will have the opportunity to do foundational analysis on important, unsolved questions across a wide range of problem spaces.

You’ll grow and improve rapidly. At Clubhouse you’ll be working with an incredible team, who love to learn from and teach each other. You’ll find yourself stretching to new areas, immersed in feedback, challenged by your teammates, and growing your skills on a daily basis.

You’ll shape the product strategy. You will get to use your own product (and talk with others while they are using it) every day, and have significant input into its development. Your ideas will always be heard. Your work will vary over time and will cover a variety of areas. On a given day, you may be launching a new way of ranking support tickets, analyzing trends in different types of user behavior, or finding ways to proactively identify content in violation of our policies.

You’ll be an owner. We believe in hiring people and giving them as much responsibility as they can handle.

You’ll create something meaningful. Social products allow people to connect in ways that were never before possible. When the telephone was invented, it suddenly allowed people to speak with others across the world. Thanks to FaceTime, grandparents everywhere can now watch their grandchildren grow up. At Clubhouse, you’ll be figuring out something entirely new for the world—a positive product that brings people’s voices together for deep and meaningful conversations, creates new relationships, builds empathy across cultures, entertains people, and helps people develop ideas that change the course of their lives.
This position is fully remote, and includes competitive base pay, a comprehensive health benefits package, company equity, 401k, plus additional benefits and stipends. The salary for this position is between $171,000 and $215,000. It may vary based on the applicant’s level of experience, education, specialized knowledge, skills, and the market rate for similar positions. The salary range is subject to change and may be modified in the future.

As an early team member at Clubhouse you will be a critical voice and have significant influence over the direction of the company. We will compensate you well, invest deeply in your development, and ensure this is the single best work experience of your life.

Our users come from all walks of life, and so do we. We hire great people from a wide variety of backgrounds. Our company is proud to be an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate in hiring or any employment decision based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex (including pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions), marital status, ancestry, physical or mental disability, genetic information, veteran status, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, or other applicable legally protected characteristics.
