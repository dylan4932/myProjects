Dev House Labs is an engineering and venture studio contributing to the Cosmos Ecosystem (https://cosmos.network). We're a young, world-class team of experts in computer science, type theory, economic game theory, risk management and enterprise software development. Our team combines traditional experience in building and scaling teams at technology companies such as a Apple, Facebook, Coinbase, IBM and Y-Combinator with crypto native experience from some of DeFi 2.0’s most impactful protocols. We're all highly passionate about Web3, Toybox and building infrastructure to bring decentralized finance to the masses. Our core engineering team is based in Toronto. Here at Dev House Labs, you’ll be joining a world-class team of experienced founders, engineers and researchers passionate about designing sustainable economic and blockchain systems. We’re well funded by a group of leading digital asset investors, hedge funds, centralized exchange venture arms and strategic angels.
We are looking for self-starters and mission driven individuals to join us as we build the future of decentralized finance and blockchain infrastructure. The ideal candidate for this role takes initiative and ownership over their work, thrives in a fast-paced and highly collaborative in-person environment, and is capable of rapidly adapting to evolving needs as required.
We are currently working on many exciting projects, but most notably:
1) Developing a more interoperable Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that allows developers to write Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC), Inter-Chain Accounts (ICA), and Inter-Chain Security (ICS) enabled Solidity and Vyper smart contracts. These advanced features enable the creation of smart contracts that can communicate and interact with other blockchain networks in the Cosmos and Polkadot ecosystems, enabling the transfer of assets and data across different blockchain platforms.
2) Experimental Proof of Stake extensions that enable new economic systems and incentives to be built. For example:
Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET): PoET is a PoS-based consensus algorithm that uses a random wait time to determine which node will create the next block. It is designed to be more energy efficient than traditional PoW-based systems and is used in the Hyperledger Sawtooth blockchain platform.
Proof of Burn (PoB): PoB is a consensus algorithm in which users must ""burn"" or destroy a certain amount of cryptocurrency in order to be eligible to create blocks. The idea is that users who are willing to destroy their own assets are more likely to act in the best interest of the network.
Proof of Capacity (PoC): PoC is a consensus algorithm that uses spare disk space to create blocks. This spare disk space is used to store a dataset called ""plot"" that is used to create blocks. The more disk space you have, the more likely you are to create a block.
Requirements:
5+ years of experience in quantitative analysis or related fields, preferably in cryptocurrency trading.
Degree in Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, or related field.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with the ability to develop and implement complex quantitative models and algorithms.
Proficiency in programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL, with a focus on developing models for cryptocurrency markets.
Experience with data analytics and visualization tools such as Pandas, NumPy, and Tableau, with a focus on cryptocurrency data.
Familiarity with cryptocurrency markets and trading strategies, including options pricing, risk management, and portfolio optimization.
Knowledge of statistical analysis and machine learning techniques, and their applications to cryptocurrency trading.
Excellent communication skills, with the ability to effectively convey complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences.
A passion for innovation and problem-solving, with the ability to work independently and as part of a team.
Responsibilities:
Develop and implement quantitative models and algorithms for use in cryptocurrency trading.
Conduct data analysis and visualization to inform trading strategies and risk management decisions in cryptocurrency markets.
Collaborate with trading and research teams to identify new cryptocurrency trading opportunities and improve existing strategies.
Design and optimize trading systems and algorithms for low latency and high frequency trading in cryptocurrency markets.
Conduct research and analysis on cryptocurrency market trends, economic indicators, and other relevant factors to inform trading decisions and risk management.
Develop and maintain automated tools and systems to support cryptocurrency trading and risk management processes.
Communicate quantitative analysis and cryptocurrency trading strategies to both technical and non-technical stakeholders, using visualizations, reports, and other communication tools.
Stay up-to-date with the latest research, trends, and best practices in quantitative analysis and cryptocurrency trading, and apply this knowledge to drive innovation and continuous improvement within the organization.

Individual pay is determined by the candidate's hiring location and additional factors, including but not limited to skillset, experience, and relevant education, certifications, or training. Applicants may not be eligible for the full salary range based on their U.S. hiring location. The recruiter can share more details about compensation for the role in your location during the hiring process.

Once performance exceeds 100% quota attainment, incentive rates may increase up to five times the standard rate with no cap on incentive compensation. For non-quota-based sales performance elements such as strategic sales objectives, Cisco may pay up to 125% of target. Cisco sales plans do not have a minimum threshold of performance for sales incentive compensation to be paid."

This is a remote position that has a great chance of being extended long term.

Job Description:

Requirements for technical (integrity) SME to support providing strategic oversight of plan and facilitate workshops

Deep understanding of Integrity hazards with understanding of the subtle similarities and differences for enhanced classification (e.g. knowing the difference between failure due to crack vs failure due to stress corrosion cracking (SCC))

Ability to provide insights to incident hazard classification based on typical industry practices and standards (i.e. CSA Z662, ASME B31.8S, European standards) (e.g. provide insights on how the structure of the data model might need to look to align with various standards)

Understanding of the various Pipeline industry incident repositories that exists and ability to have future view to how we can set the MVP in a manner for future expansion with those additional repositories (e.g. investigate how decisions on the MVP may impact our ability to expand to other data sources)

Familiarity with the use of incident data to inform integrity decisions, assess emerging hazards, and build risk/reliability models (e.g. having an understanding of the overall use cases will allow the ability to fill in some of the blank where the requirements may not be fully specified – or know where the blanks are that need further thought)

Ability to draw on experience in these areas to predict challenges or roadblocks and set up the effective timing and workshop questions to address

Goals:

Build a repository of Industry and Enbridge incident data (compiled from BUs, PHMSA, CER, TSSA, CEPA, AGA, CGA repositories) leveraging machine learning models to bring consistency and further detail the threat categorizations and incident details

Bring together data repositories into one source with detailed information on the incident operators (e.g., detail on operating regions, asset types)

Will leverage the text fields associated with incidents and apply machine learning / text mining models to bring more detail and enhance Integrity modelling capabilities (e.g., failure mode, primary failure cause, impacts of failure, health and safety consequences, financial consequences).

Ability for integrity/risk engineers to “Correct” incorrectly classified incidents or fill in additional details that were not captured by the original models

This initiative embodies the “Data as an Asset” perspective and will allow for better risk and reliability assessment, enabling optimal allocation of company budgets to areas of highest need, improve safety and regulatory compliance, and help to lower risks associated with our operational assets.
